        <b>1) Helping others? You will live longer.</b> Different scientists from different countries made special researches and in 2013 they came to the same conclusion: 
            we can really live longer if we start to help other disinterestedly. According to this statistical data, we can reduce mortality by 22%. 
            Many people ask how many we should help others. According to the researches 100 hours will be enough, but it is not the standard, you can help just 50-75 hours and it also will be useful for you. 
            But you need remember about the main thing, your helping should be regularly and systematic.<br><br>

        <b>2) Improving mood and well-being.</b> Helping others, we improve our mood. 
            The scientists are sure that it’s enough five little acts of kindness during the week (do it for 6 weeks) and you will notice that your well-being is much better. 
            It is very important to know that one-off help doesn’t matter. And the positive results after helping can quickly disappear. That’s why it is important often to help and gladly and derive benefit from it. 
            If you like to help others it seems to me that you will never suffer from depression.<br><br>

        <b>3) More communication.</b> When you help other people you need to communicate with them. Who knows, maybe you will find new friend or the twin soul. Loneliness can badly influence on your health. 
            Those, who are surrounded with kind people, have a long and happy life.

        <b>4) You will have lower blood pressure.</b> In 1998 were organized interesting scientist researches. As a result, older people (over 50 years old), who decided to spend about 4 hours per week helping others, 
            had a 40% less chance of developing hypertension in the next four years. The scientists consider that the positive effect of helping can be connected with stress reduction. 
            Volunteering can motivate you to become better and better, positively adjusts and gives support to cope with daily troubles.<br><br>

        <b>5) Less pain.</b> If you are suffering from the chronic illness, you feel the discomfort from time to time but you can avoid this feeling. Just start to help those people, who have the same disease as you have. 
            Even in a hospital, if you’ll help others, you will feel much better, become more confidence, receive positive energy and be able to control the situation.<br><br>
